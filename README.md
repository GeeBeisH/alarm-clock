# alarm-clock
"alarm-clock" is just a simple JavaScript alarm clock that I created to display while I work. The "set alarm time" will arm the alarm and the "snooze alarm" will add 10 minutes to the time.

## Installation

Just copy and paste in any directory of your choice.

## Usage

Just run index.html
- The number of times the alarm will "chime" can be adjusted in script.js line 34.(default is 12)
- The number of snooze minutes can be changed on line 49.(default is 10)

## Future work
- The CSS works ok on larger screens but do need work to become more responsive.
- A Reset Alarm button and code can be added(I may still do this when I get some time.
